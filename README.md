The map is based on the Interactive Map Generator IMAGE from Eurostat. The base HTML file has been complemented by a separate javascript file, 
enabling automatic data-loading from a CSV file. Furthermore, the HTML file has been customised to include drop-downs in order to filter on years and indicators. All credit
of the design and structure of the map goes to Eurostat.

The CSV is automatically loaded by the python script, which retrieves the latest data on the 13 MIP Scoreboard indicators as published by Eurostat.
